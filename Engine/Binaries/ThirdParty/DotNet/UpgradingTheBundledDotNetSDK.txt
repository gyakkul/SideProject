Upgrading the bundled .NET SDK


High level:
i.   Identify the new .NET SDK version to be installed 
ii.  Download & submit dotnet files for Linux and Mac
iii. Download & submit dotnet files for Windows
iv.  Upgrade, test, and submit any code changes
v.   Delete the old version from perforce


i.   Identify the new .NET SDK version to be installed 
e.g. by looking here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet
Choose a .NET SDK version - not the .NET version 
i.e. use 6.0.202, not 6.0.4


Let's assume we're upgrading from 6.0.200 to 6.0.202...


ii.  Download & submit dotnet files for Linux and Mac

On a Mac or Linux system, from a command prompt:

1. cd into Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/DotNet

2. Run './download.sh 6.0.202' 
(This command will download and extract installations for linux, mac-x64, and mac-arm64)

3. Submit Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/DotNet/6.0.202/... to perforce


iii. Download & submit dotnet files for Windows

On a Windows sytem, from a powershell window:

1. cd into Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\DotNet

2. .\download.ps1 6.0.202

3. Submit Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/DotNet/6.0.202/windows/... to perforce


iv.  Upgrade, test, and submit code changes

1. Replace references to the old SDK version everywhere that is needed e.g. replace 6.0.200 with 6.0.202 in (at least) these files

    Engine\Source\Programs\Shared\EpicGames.Build\Unreal.cs
    Engine\Build\BatchFiles\GetDotnetPath.bat
    Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Linux\SetupDotnet.sh
    Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Mac\SetupDotnet.sh
    Engine\Build\InstalledEngineFilters.xml
    Engine\Build\Rsync\RsyncEngine.txt

   Find any others that reference the old version number.

2. Ensure C# projects compile using the new .NET SDK - especially 
    UnrealBuildTool (use GenerateProjectFiles.bat), 
    AutomationTool and all its script modules (RunUAT.bat -List)
    IncludeTool (via Horde preflight static analysis option)

   Building via Visual Studio will not exercise the newly-installed .NET SDK.

3. Test vigorously, including generous preflighting.

4. Submit changed files

5. Set a reminder for a few days from now


v.   Delete the old version

When the reminder fires, assuming all is well, delete the old dotnet directory from perforce
    e.g p4 delete Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/DotNet/6.0.200/...
